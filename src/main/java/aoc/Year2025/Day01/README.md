# [Day 1: Secret Entrance](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)

My first AoC puzzle ever \o/.

## Thoughts

The solution is pretty straight forward in my opinion although the modulo thingy wasn't on my mind when implementing something like this puzzle requires (e.g. a Dial from 0 to 99).

I will keep this in mind.

## Design

I simply implemented [Dial](Dial.java) with a corresponding method `turn` which turns the Dial according to the given rotation notation (e.g. `L1` or `R2`). The constructor of this class sets the position to the given starting point which is `50`.
